Over the week youtubers playing the widely recognizable game Red Dead Redemption, were posting videos killing a suffragette in the game. 
This upset alot of people, and youtube took action by taking the videos, and in some cases the youtuber themselves were banned too. 

The problem with this ban is that youtube pick and chooses when to put their "guidelines" into use. There are tons of videos that have received lots of views, and attention that definitely break the guidelines of youtube. But, they have never been bothered or taken down.

The problem has been solved though as of today. Youtube said it was a mistake to take the videos down instead they age restricted them. But, the problem with balancing freedom, and restrictions is still one that will rear its head throughout the years especially on the internet.
